# cynical-selection
Allo-media data selection tool

This code implements the data selection method and algorithms proposed in Axelrod's paper [CYNICAL SELECTION OF LANGUAGE MODEL TRAINING DATA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02279.pdf), based on the paper's explanations and the Perl implementation Axelrod proposed [on github](https://github.com/amittai/cynical)

Comments in code and details on usage to come, but it's pretty simple right now.
